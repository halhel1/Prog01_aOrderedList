# Project-01
What the program does:
This program is used to manage a list of cars in format.This program reads input from a text file in the form of "Either A or D, Car Make, Car Year, Car Price" and 
performs an operation that appends a car to a list,when the first index is an "A", or removes a car from a list,when the first index is "D." Then a new list,sorted 
by make then year, with all the add and remove operations already completeled will be created in the form of an output text file.

How to use it:
The user is prompted to enter an existing input file text name that should contain the input. If the file does not exist or can not be located then the program will
prompt the user to enter the either "Y",to continue, or "N" to end the program. Entering "Y" will allow the user to attempt to enter the file name again, and if the
file name happens to be valid than the user will be prompted to enter an output file name that can be an already existing file, or the program will create a file of
the name. As long as the file name entered is not one that only allows read operations then the program will conclude, but not without writing in the output file the
newly updated list
